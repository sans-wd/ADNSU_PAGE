              and technical basis of the Institute. Was instructed. As a result,
              a certain percentage of the income of Azneft was transferred to
              the fund of the Institute and acquisition of the equipment of
              Vladikavkaz Polytechnic. Since 1923 the Institute has been named
              the Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute, named after M. Azizbayov. In
              1929 alumni of the University Barinov was a rector of the
              University. On May 12, 1929, the faculty "Agriculture" was
              separated from the Institute, and the "Agricultural Institute" was
              established freely. On May 29, 1930, the name "Azerbaijan
              Polytechnic Institute" was renamed, and it was renamed "Azerbaijan
              Oil Institute" (AOI). In 1931, "Azerbaijan Institute of the Kiyabi
              Industry" was established. Azerbaijan Oil Refinery Institute was
              founded on the base of the Azerbaijan Oil Institute in Ganja,
              Grozny, Ufa and Ishimbay. The Institute's name was renamed as the
              "Azerbaijan Oil Institute", and the training of engineers was
              carried out at the following faculties: On June 19, 1930, the
              Azerbaijan Construction Institute was established ( On September
              1, 1934, he was again transferred to the Azerbaijan Oil Institute
              under the name "Architecture and Construction faculty). In the
              thirty-third year of the Polytechnic Institute, 3267 students,
              more than 3,000 listeners at the faculty of correspondence
              education, have been transformed into one of the most prominent
              universities of the former Soviet Union and became the first high
              technical school in Transcaucasia. In 1931, the Institute was
              nominated the Red Labor Order of the Government of the Republic of
              Azerbaijan for its achievements in the training of specialists in
              the oil industry. The rapid development of industry in Azerbaijan
              in connection with the country's industrialisation required oil
              and the engineering staff for other fields. Thus, the creation of
              a large-scale industrial institute in the republic was a priority
              for that time. On October 10, 1934, the Oil Institute became a
              member of the Engineering Institute of Mechanical Engineering,
              Power Engineering etc., for industrial fields and the preparation
              of engineers.

              <p>
                On December 25, 1940, the Institute was rewarded with the Red
                Banner of the Alliance's highest awards for its achievements
                over its 20th anniversary. In connection with the beginning of
                the war in 1941, new tasks were put in front of the Institute
                and its employees, and their concerns had increased. From the
                beginning of the war, employees and students of the Institute
                were sent to the front to give their debts to the country. In
                1941 S.B.Gokayev was appointed rector of the Institute. In these
                years, a special gang was created to build defence facilities in
                the Institute. Sending workers in the industry and institutional
                students to the front has led to a large number of staff
                shortages in managing production at mining and factories
                operating under the motto "Everything is for Frontline". To
                overcome the shortfall, according to the decision of the
                Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the measures to
                improve the training of staff at the Azerbaijan Industrial
                Institute named after M. Azizbayov on March 5-12, 1943,
                1,000-1200 students were enrolled in 1943/44 academic year. By
                the Council of People's Commissars of November 12, 1943, the
                publication of textbooks, textbooks for students in Azerbaijan
                was consolidated, and exceptional closed food and industrial
                goods stores for students and academic staff of the Institute
                were launched. In 1943 the Institute was accepted 1147 and 844
                people 1944. Over 1,000 engineers were trained during the war.
                In 1945 there were 4500 students, including listeners of
                preparatory faculty. On March 11, 1944, by the decision of the
                directive authorities, pre-war rules were established in higher
                education institutions, and staff training was promoted as the
                most important problem. After the war, there were fundamental
                changes in the life of the Institute. At that time, six of 8
                faculties were directly involved in training personnel for the
                oil industry. The post-war expansion of the Institute's
                activities were related to the development of the industry and,
                first of all, the oil industry in the country. If before the
                war, 98% of oil production fell to Baku, Grozny and Maykop;
                after the war, rich oil fields in the Ural-Volga, Emba, Central
                Asia, Kazakhstan and Far East regions were discovered, and their
                mines had sharply increased demand for oil specialists. In those
                years, the graduates of the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute
                played a key role in the development of these fields. In 1946,
                the Institute was subordinated to the People's Commissariat of
                the USSR under the supervision of the USSR Department of
                Polytechnic and Industry Higher Education Institutions. In the
                structure of the Institute in 1950 functioned
                Geological-Exploration, Petroleum, Technological, Mechanical,
                Energetic, Engineering-Economy, Transport and
                Architecture-Construction faculties. In 1952, Azerbaijan
                Polytechnic Institute was established to prepare specialists for
                civil construction, transport and mechanical engineering based
                on the Institute of Architecture and Construction, Transport,
                Faculties of Mechanics and the Faculty of Hydromelioration of
                the Azerbaijan Institute of Agriculture. From the Azerbaijan
                Institute of Industry to Polytechnic Institute, 57 professors
                and teachers have passed 11 chairs, and the Institute has only
                started to prepare specialists in the oil field. Extension of
                the evening and part-time education has been done. According to
                the decision of the Union Government on March 14, 1959, the
                Institute has been renamed to Azerbaijan Institute of Oil and
                Chemistry named after M. Azizbayov (AzIOC). This was due to the
                fact that the chemical industry was declared a priority area in
                the country. Prior to the AzIOC, the developing Union has set to
                prepare highly qualified engineers and scientists for oil and
                petrochemical industries. In 1951-1959 the Institute produced
                6695 engineers, of which 3501 were Azerbaijanis, including 749
                girls. In these years, according to the decision of the
                republican government, the speciality of industrial economics
                from the Department of Planned Economics and the Azerbaijan
                State University for the development of mineral deposits were
                transferred to AzOI and the radio engineering speciality from
                AzOI Polytechnic Institute. In the 1958-1959 academic year, a
                department was established in Sumgait to study at the evening
                department of young people working there. By the decision of the
                Government of Azerbaijan dated March 30, 1960, a training and
                advisory centre was established in Sumgayit for studying evening
                and part-time departments of AzIOC. The decision envisages the
                preparation of a member of the training and consultation station
                for synthesis and synthetic rubber, chemical and
                machine-building specialities. In the 1962-1963 academic year,
                the educational-advisory station in Sumgayit was transformed
                into a branch of AzOI as a part of the evening and part-time
                department. The first admission to the branch was in 1962. The
                first student admission to the unit was carried out in 1962, and
                225 students were admitted to the evening department and 125
                students in the correspondence department. According to the
                decision of the Union Government dated June 3, 1965, the branch
                was transformed into a factory of technical sciences at the
                synthetic rubber plant in Sumgayit. Since there were no
                appropriate conditions for teaching, most of the courses were
                held at the school of Sumgayit No. 11 and the building of the
                8-year school in the City of Chemists. By 1970, most of the
                teachers were educators invited from AzOI. Since 1992, the
                branch in Sumgayit has been functioning as a Free Industrial
                Industrial Institute, becoming a Sumgayit State University since
                June 13, 2000. In November 1965, the Institute celebrated its
                45th anniversary. The 50th anniversary of AzOI was celebrated on
                July 5, 1971, with the participation of the government
                delegation at the club named after Shahriyar, including the head
                of our republic, Heydar Aliyev. The government awarded more than
                100 members of the collective honorary titles and decrees, and
                30 were given apartments. The Institute was awarded the Honorary
                Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic
                for services in the training of qualified personnel for the
                national economy of Turkmenistan. In 1978, Professor Ibrahimov
                was re-appointed as the rector of the Institute. The Azerbaijan
                Oil and Chemistry Institute employees named after M. Azizbeyov
                worked in the legendary "Oil Rocks" and in Baku Refineries,
                Sumgayit Large Chemicals Enterprises and Research Institutes of
                the Republican Academy of Sciences, Tyumen, Sakhalin, Tatarstan
                Mines and all corners of the country. The AzIOC was included in
                the list of 70 leading universities of the former Soviet Union
                in the republican higher educational institutions, under the
                decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of
                Ministers of the USSR № 271 of April 6 1978 "Enhancing the
                effectiveness of scientific research in high schools". That is
                why in 1979, the name of the faculty was changed to
                "Gas-Oil-Mining". In 1988, under the joint order of the Ministry
                of the Shipbuilding Industry and the Ministry of Higher and
                Secondary Special Education of the Union, Nord Scientific
                Production Association and AzNKI established the second
                educational-scientific-production complex.

            In September 2015, by order of President Ilham Aliyev, the
            University was named the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial
            University, which was tasked with training qualified personnel not
            only for the oil field but also for the entire domestic industry. In
            addition, since the new academic year, the French-Azerbaijan
            University (UFAZ), established under the Presidential Decree at
            ASOIU. This year, 143 students were admitted to the UFAZ, which will
            be taught in English, with the opportunity to earn a diploma from
            the University of Strasbourg, one and one of the most prestigious
            universities of France in the world, with the ASOIU diploma alumni,
            and this is a total of 2400 young people technical and engineering
            specialities, and grow up as highly qualified personnel for the
            country's economy. One of the crucial steps taken by ASOIU for the
            synthesis of education and science in the industry is the creation
            of the "Eazi START" startup school. Along with talented students and
            masters, the aim of the startup school, with the participation of
            doctoral students, university professors and professors, is to
            prepare a business project and build production requiring minimal
            investment based on innovations in science. At the end of the
            2015-2016 academic year, 15 out of the drafted projects have been
            widely presented, and investments are currently being made. At the
            same time, the AzII-IT Academy was established at the University to
            absorb students' information technology deeply. Over the past year,
            more than 100 young people have graduated from the IT Academy found
            around the world-renowned Oracle, Microsoft, with Autocad resources.
            They have received certificates on various levels. It should be
            noted that currently, Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University
            cooperate closely with international students, including Georgia
            State University (USA), Zigen University (Germany), Ploektti Oil and
            Gas University (Romania), Trondheim City Science and Technology
            University (Norway), Russia's State Oil and Gas University (Russia),
            Genya University (Italy), Nitsa Sofia-Antipolis University (France),
            Athens National Technical University (Greece), Khazar State
            University of Technology and Engineering (Kazakhstan). At the same
            time, a joint Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program with
            Zigen University in Germany and a Joint Master program in Business
            Administration (MBA) with Georgia State University in the United
            States can be highlighted.
